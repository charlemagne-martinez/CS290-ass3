            <li> A challenge I had was figuring out what image to choose of myself as I don't have much
                 that show me clearly. I worked through this by going through my photos and ultimately settling
                 on an image that seemed the most clear. Another challenge I had was figuring out how I wanted to 
                 publish these pages to the web. I worked through them through a lot of referencing of the assignment
                 prompt, and google searches. A third challenge was understanding the unix commands when publishing the 
                 pages on the ENGR web space. I worked through this through a mix of the links provided in the prompt
                 as well as some google searching as well. A fourth thing I encountered was figuring out how to change the 
                 background color, the text, and how to space things out between the text. I worked through this by doing 
                 some google searches, which have been very helpful. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Something I learned from this assignment was how to publish pages to the web, so that it's not only 
                viewable locally, but also live on the web. Another thing I learned was Unix permissions. I don't 
                entirely understand it all but I think I at least somewhat do and at least understand enough to 
                accomplish the needed permissions as specified. 

            </li>

            <li> 
                The resources that were most helpful were the links within the assignment #1 prompt, the campuswire forum, 
                and the notes I had from lectures. I used the campuswire forum by referring to it when I realized I had 
                similar if not the same questions that others had previously asked. I used the links and the notes I had
                from lectures whenever there was something I came across while doing the assignment that made me think of 
                something I saw earlier that could possibly help in solving it.

            <li>
                Something challenging about this assignment was figuring out how to get something to look like how I expected.
                For example, there were numerous times where I envisioned what I wanted but just didn't know what exactly to 
                do in order to get it look the way I wanted. I solved these problems through extensive google searches, 
                referring to my notes, the lectures, and yeah. 
            </li>

            <li>
                I learned a lot about how to apply the CSS concepts that we went over during the past few weeks, as well as 
                a concepts that weren't exactly taught but were things I saw from my google searches that seemed to solve
                what I wanted to do. Yes, there were indeed some insights that I picked up from doing this assignment. 
                As I continued to do this assignment, some of the concepts that I wasn't understanding so much earlier 
                were starting to all come together, little by little. 
            </li>

            <li>
                The resources that were helpful are as follows: GOOGLE searches, lecture recordings, lecture notes, readings,
                notes I took myself, campuswire. I used google EXTENSIVELY when I wanted to find an answer to a question I had.
                I used the lecture recordings to reinforce specific concepts and especially those that Hess mentioned could be
                beneficial when working on this assignment. I used the lecture notes and readings assigned as well to clarify 
                things. I used the notes that I took as well (which is code that I followed during lecture) to find any comments
                I had that mentioned how something could be useful. Finally, I used campuswire to see if there was something that
                someone had previously asked about and was something I was wondering about. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Although there were definitely more than two things I googled for this assignment, one in particular was
                about flexboxes and flex items. Another thing was how to make something pop out (the add twit button).
                As mentioned, I used google for a lot more different searches but these in particular are just a few things
                I did search. 
            </li>

                There were some challenging parts of this assignment indeed. Some of them include saving the content
                of a newly created twit after doing a search query. I solved this by having a call to a array making 
                function I initally created to store the twit content and authors of the OG 8 twits. I ended up modifying
                it and having conditionals that would run based on parameters I sent that would create a temporary array, 
                copy the content to that, setting the array I return equal to that temp array, and then setting the last index
                of that array equal to the twit text and author input of the user. Another challenging part was the live search.
                I ended up using a pretty chunk of code I had for two other functions that dealt with removing any remaining twits
                and essentially calling createTwit() a certain amount of times based on the length of the twitTextArray I made, 
                which was updated every time a twit was created, to ensure I get the right length. I also changed an 'if' to a 'while'
                and shifted some things around which seemed to help. There are also several other things, but these were just a few. 
            </li>


            <li>
                I learned A LOT about how Javascript works. One thing in particular is that I learned more about events and 
                how that can be used in several ways. I also learned that you can apparently set the value of any index
                of an array at any time, and the array will seemingly seemingly grow in size based on that. This was something
                I searched about while editing my makeArray() function, and something I found from this stackoverflow: 
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33903514/change-array-size-by-just-adding-element-and-no-push-javascript.
                I also enforced my understanding of how having a variable set equal to "getElementsByClassName" creates an 
                HTML collection that's live and automatically changes if anything happens to the DOM. This led me to deciding
                to create arrays that I continuously update so that I can keep track of the twit texts and author. There are
                things in Javascript that I'm not so used to as much yet, but yeah. 
            </li>


            <li>
                Resources I used included: lecture recordings, lecture notes I had, readings from class website,
                campuswire, extensive google searching (a lot about how things in Javascript work). 
            </li>


            <li>
                One thing I had to Google for this assignment was how getElementsByClassName worked because from my 
                experience in this assignment, I couldn't rely on that to stay the same size as its an HTML collection and
                changes as the DOM changes. This was something the lecture notes mentioned, but google searching this 
                definitely solidified my understanding of it, and led me to deciding to use two arrays to keep track of
                twit text and authors as mentioned above. Another thing I searched was the includes() method, as this was
                something I ended up using for the for loop that would loop through the twits and decide which ones to remove
                from the DOM. This was a method I saw from a site and ended up proving helpful. There were a lot more things
                I did google searches for, but these two were ones in particular I wanted to point out.
